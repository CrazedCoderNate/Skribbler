# Skribbler
Skribbler is in alpha stage, and may not work with 100% accuracy. 
For now, you need to load the source, setup your compiler to target the main class within StartSkribbl.java.
When you want the program to draw for you, you need to open Starter/StartSkribbl.java, replace "Enter Search @uery Here" String with your query.
Run the source, alt tab over to the browser and wait for it to draw.

# Awaiting changes

Resolution options,
Prompt,
Runnable jar or exe.

# Known Issues
Skribbl.io itself is the limiting factor for speed of drawing. It only allows around 1 click every 10-15 milliseconds, Further improvements may include line drawing instead of individual points as a workaround to this limiting factor.
